    # FormGET On|Off
    #   Determines whether forms submitted by GET will be decoded.

    # FormPOST On|Off
    #   Determines whether forms submitted by POST will be decoded.
    #
    # FormMaxSize nnnn
    #   If set, this limits the maximum size of data mod_form will
    #   accept. If that is exceeded, an error will be returned to the
    #   client and the request is aborted.
    #
    # FormDelim delims
    #   Form fields are normally separated by ampersand &. However,
    #   when using GET with a link rather than a form, some people
    #   prefer to use a different delimiter, usually semicolon ;. This
    #   sets what character(s) will be treated as a delimiter.
